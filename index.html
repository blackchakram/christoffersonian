             I worked as a software engineering contractor for TerraXML for two months. My job was to help tackle a backlog of bugs and feature requests for a ten year old piece of software on collaboration and document management. This software was complex and required a solid understanding of Java, Javascript, C#, XML, and many other languages and frameworks.

             I spent nine years as a science and math teacher, successfully engaging students and teaching college level concepts. My expertise was in relating to students and understanding alternate ways of explaining concepts when it was evident a student didn't understand. I continually improved lessons from year to year and explored ways of making content engaging.

             During my college years I worked as a scientist and web designer/developer for the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics, a world renowned space science research insitute closely linked to NASA. While at LASP, I had many roles including programming a database to analyze over a million data points, designing dynamic websites for scientists to organize and access data, and working with a small team to create a custom JIRA workflow.

             I've written and published my own book through Amazon, titled <i><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wizard-Outcast-Blackstaff-Josh-Christofferson/dp/1460911857">Blackstaff: Wizard Outcast</a></i>. This is a gamebook or "Choose your own adventure" book involving not just writing, but gameplay mechanics, art, and design. I also published this book in several eReader formats.

             I ran tabletop roleplaying game sessions for over a decade. For the span of several years, we played a science fiction setting. We decided to run a podcast, which I set up, recorded, edited, and maintained on my own. We produced over a hundred episodes and even gained a small paying following through Patreon. While this ended years ago, the entire set of episodes can be found on <a href="https://archive.org/details/CloseTheAirlock">archive.org</a>.

             I've been interested in game development and design for years. This inculdes not just video games, but tabletop roleplaying systems and board games as well. I constantly have a least two or three concepts in the works at any one time. Most notably, I've spent somewhere over 600 hours working with Unity3D to learn design and programming principles for complex video game design. Currently, I'm working on a game called Autoquest, which features an intelligent, autonomous hero journeying through a fantasy land and reporting to you what his adventures have been.

           <p>
             I design worlds. Partly because I want to, but also because the vast amount of ideas I have must have an outlet. I've currently put the last few years into my magnum opus, a huge and incredibly detailed world with nearly a hundred nations covering an area roughly the size of Asia. I also have plans for this world to be the basis for a series of novels about adventure and intrigue in a land where the gods walk among men.
